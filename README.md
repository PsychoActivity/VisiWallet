# Slideshot Wallet
Create a bitcoin wallet out of a camera photograph or image from the internet.

While this is very cool(in my opinion), for security purposes, it is advised that you DO NOT use an image from the internet due to the ubiquity and readily available nature of online photographs, and instead you take a unique, candid photograph from your phone's own camera.
