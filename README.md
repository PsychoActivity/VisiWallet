# Safety Notice
NOTE: This software is intended for creative use rather than security. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  This application is NOT a replacement to existing cold storage and hardware wallet options.  There is no safer alternative than storing your bitcoin in a total offline environment secured with the latest encryption standards.  Treat photographs taken with this app like you would treat your most embarrassing nudes.  Anyone with an exact copy of the photograph and the proper knowledge/equipment - such as this app on another phone - will be able to access the funds on your wallet.


# Slideshot Wallet
Create a bitcoin wallet out of a camera photograph or image from the internet.

While this is a very cool feature(in my opinion), for security purposes i.e. if the intent is for personal bitcoin storage, it is advised that you DO NOT use an image downloaded from the internet due to the ubiquity and readily available nature of online photographs, and instead you take a unique, candid photograph from your phone's camera.  Every photowallet generated will also generate a unique 24 word backup seed phrase like a normal wallet.  You should write the words down on a piece of paper and secure them properly. The general rule for all wallets that are NOT hardware wallets, is that you should never store more than 1 months salary on it for any extended period of time.

# General Notes
1. It is actually safe to share the images onto social media networks.  Social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter preprocess and compress all uploaded images, thereby destroying the original data that was computed to generate the wallet.  

2. I would advise against sending a copy of these photos to your email, through SMS or any form of cloud storage.  If you would rather have a backup of this photograph in an online environment, then it would be safer to export the image as raw encrypted binary data which you could then decrypt and restore the original image at a later time(this feature is not available yet, but will be soon).

3. The best way to use this photo as a legitimate backup to secure your bitcoin would be to take a candid photo or selfie from your phone's camera and store it on an encrypted flash drive in a cool, indoor, locked and safe environment.  Remember to delete all other copies.

HAVE FUN, BE SAFE! :)
